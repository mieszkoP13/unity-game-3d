  - Hello
  - Greetings
  - What is this place?
  - It is an old volcano ravine, be careful on your way as it is full of dangerous
    creatures.
  - Can you give me some movement tips?
  - Use W, A, S, D to walk around, E to interact, G to drop an item. Press Spacebar
    to jump, Hold Shift to sprint and Ctrl to crouch. Simple, right?
  - Yes, thank you.
  - No problem, take care!
