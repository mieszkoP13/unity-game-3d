Hi, 

The Model is seperated into two hierarchies. "Portal" and a subcategory within it called "Base".
All parts of the model are seperate, but parented to the object called "Portal". Only 2 objects 
were joined together and that would be the object called "Base (stone slabs)", it is a duplicate
of one of the stone slabs but moved up and rotated 180 degrees. 

If there are any problems please let me know, I will leave my social media links down below if
you would like to contact me.
